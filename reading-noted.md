## Third day 102! 
**12/14/2020**


We learned Git basic commands 
ls = list

ls-l = detailed directory

pwd = where am I

cd = change directory 

tab = continue typing

mkdir = creat new folder "name of the folder" 

pwd = print working direct 

clear: clear everything in the terminal

touch = creats file

cd.. = previous directory

git add = it adds all the files after we clone

git commit -m 'ANY THING YOU WANT'

git push origin main = the files go to Github
