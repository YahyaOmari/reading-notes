## Second day 201! 
_My name is Yahya, I am 22 years old and I am a fresh graduate from universiry of Jordan. Here I will be writing my notes and solving my assignments_.

First I want to write about growth mindset..

 Gorwth mindset helps someone to be a better programmer and a teammate. Where somone can improve from his abilties even if they 
 were basic and one day he will acheive what he wants. One of the things that can help someone to acheive what he wants is that 
 to avoid ~~toxic~~ people, because they always give negative energy and beleive me you do not need them at all. Maybe you can go 
 back to them one day when you acheive your goals and show them that you made it and you really can do even better. 
 
 *3 things that I recomend myself to do:
 
    *Keep improving of myself, even with the basic things.
   
    *Read, if there are things I did not understand I can search for them and at     
    the end if I did not uderstand them by myself I can ask anyone to help, it 
    is not a shame, the shame is to be shy and not to ask because if you did     
    not ask you will never learn and improve of yourself.
   
    *Give time to myself, sit with my family or go out to see my friends 
    
    because if I stayed infront of my PC all the time I will get exhausted. 

>At the end, compare yourself by yesterday, last week or last year you will see a difference and you will be proud of yourself. Hard work pays off.
