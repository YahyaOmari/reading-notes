# **Welcome to my page**.

_My name is Yahya, I am 22 years old and I am a fresh graduate from universiry of Jordan. Here I will be writing my notes and solving my assignments_.

First I want to write about growth mindset..
 Gorwth mindset helps someone to be a better programmer and a teammate. Where somone can improve from his abilties even if they were basic and one day he will acheive what he wants. One of the things that can help someone to acheive what he wants is that to avoid toxic people, because they always give negative energy and beleive me you do not need them at all. Maybe you can go back to them one day when you acheive your goals and show them that you made it and you really can do even better.
