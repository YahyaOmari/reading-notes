We learned basic Git commands and I will be writing them.
ls = list

cd = change directory 

pwd = print working direct 

Tree = whole directory of the device visualised 

cd.. = previous directory

ls-l = detailed directory 

"Kew" tab = let the terminal continues by itself

code. = it gives the code for the folder

clear = delete everything you wrote just in the "Terminal"

mkdir = make directory new folder

touch = it creats an html file

cd.. = go back 


git clone = coppies the code

git add = it add all the files after we clone

git commit -m 'ANY  COMMENT'

git push arigin main = the files go to github

git pull origin main
