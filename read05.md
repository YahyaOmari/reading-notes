## Summary
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box.
We can use CSS in the same document of HTML, but it's better and to use
it in a seperate docuement by "Fname.css"
There are three ways to use colors ..
1. RGB Values (Values for redd, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255. )
2. Hex Codes (VHex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.)
3. Color Names (Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.)
