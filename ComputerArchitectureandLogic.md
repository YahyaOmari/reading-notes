## How a computer works ..
To better imagine **how a computer works**, knowing what is inside will make it easier. Here are the main components of a computer:

1. CPU – or Central Processing Unit is considered the most 
important component in a computer and for good reason.

2. RAM – Random Access Memory, or RAM for short, is a computer 
component where data used by the operating system and software 
applications store data so that the CPU can process them quickly.

3. HDD – Also known as Hard Disk Drive, it is the component where 
photos, apps, documents and such are kept. Although they are still 
being used, we have much faster types of storage devices such as 
solid state drives (SSD) that are also more reliable.

4. Motherboard – There is no acronym for this component but without it, 
there can’t be a computer. 

5. Video and Sound Cards – Two components which help the user interact
 with the computer.

6. Network adapter – Even though it is not actually required to operate 
the computer, the Network adapter improves the user’s experience as it 
provides access to the internet.

## Bits and binary ..

Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data. A binary digit, 
or bit, is the smallest unit of data in computing. It is represented 
by a 0 or a 1. Binary numbers are made up of binary digits (bits), 
eg the binary number 1001.

## Logic circuit ..

A computer is an electrical circuit build using wires. We'll think of each 
wire in the circuit as carrying a single information element, called a bit. 
The word bit comes from Binary digIT, using the term binary because a bit can 
have either of two possible values, 0 and 1. In electrical terms, you can think 
of zero volts representing 0 and five volts representing 1; but for our purposes, 
the specific voltages aren't important — and indeed there are varying systems for 
interpreting voltage levels as 0 or 1.
