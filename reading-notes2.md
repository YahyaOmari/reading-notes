## Second day 201! 
**12/13/2020**


I learned how to install programs where we will be using these programs for the rest of the course and how to change Virtualization through the f10 thing.

How to connect ubuntu with WSL and how to install some features.

How to use GitHub, Markdown and use a theme to my page which will make it nicer. We have to use README.md or INDEX.md so it will work.
